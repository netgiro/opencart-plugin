===============================================


Supported OpenCart Versions:
================
All v1.4.x & 1.5.x versions


What does it do:
================
This contrib adds support for Netgiro.is POST IFRAME payment integration
Instead of redirecting customers to an external site, customers are shown the secure payment form inside of an iframe right on your store's checkout page.
The customer never leaves and likely won't even realize he was using an iframe because it is seamless integrated into the site.
After payment, customer is then shown to your cart success page as normal.


Requirements:
==============
  * You will of course need to have a gateway account.


Main features:
==============
  * PA-DSS Compliant as no sensitive data is stored on your site
  * Loads seamlessly onsite via iFrame to keep customer on your site during payment
  * No need for private SSL. However, some browsers will throw warning about having secure info in an iframe after the payment is already made. So it won't affect the sale.
  * No files overwritten
  * Customers stay Onsite using a secure iFrame for payment
  * Debug Logging (logs debug info to your system error log for troubleshooting)
